The goal of this Neodiprion phylogeny project was to produce pseudo-reference based genomes in the coordinate space of a single, well-characterized genomes. Then using those genomes, assess how breaking up the genomes in different ways yield different phylogenies. We also use a multiple regression approach to identify genomic features that may impact the phylogenies produced and identify a region of interest where the gene trees differ drastically from the species tree produced by whole genome datasets. 

All scripts needed to produce smaller datasets are available here. Rather than one large README document, please see 4 specific README documents to produce each dataset (makegenomes_README, windows_README, genes_README, and SNPs_README). There are also scripts to produce different statistics from the read depth of the genomes to calculating divergence that are not part of larger pipelines. Please see the scripts themselves and papers methods for these scripts.
